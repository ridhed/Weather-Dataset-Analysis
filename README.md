<!-- Described the project in brief -->
The Notebook described in the section will query the daily-summaries dataset to retrieve the desired data based on few constraints.

# Let's understand the basic phases in Data Science Project
1. Business Understanding
 -Data mining goals are defined.
 -The fundamental requirement is to understand client and business objectives.
 -Current data mining scenario factors in resources, constraints and
assumptions should also be taken into the consideration.
2. Data Understanding
 -In this stage, a sanity check is conducted to understand whether it is appropriate for data mining goals.
 -The data is collected from various sources within the organization.
 -It is a highly complex process since data and process from various sources are unlikely to match easily.
3. Data Preparation
 -The data is production ready in this stage.
 -The data from diverse sources should be nominated, cleaned, transformed,formatted, anonymized, and created.
 -Data cleaning is a process to "clean" the data by smoothing noisy data and
satisfying in missing values.
4. Modelling
 -In this stage, mathematical models are used to determine the data patterns.
 -Suitable modelling techniques need to be chosen for the prepared data set.
 -After that, create a scenario to validate the model. Then run the model on the prepared data set.
5. Evaluation
 -In this stage, patterns recognized are examined against business objectives.
 -A go or no-go decision should be taken to move the model in the deployment phase.
6. Deployment
 -In this stage, ship your data mining.
 -Discoveries (model/reports) to every business operation.
 -A thorough deployment plan, for shipping, maintenance, and monitoring of
data mining discoveries is created. â€“ Knowledge Management.
